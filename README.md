# Credit Risk Prediction Project

This repository contains a complete notebook for predicting loan default risk using data from loan applicants and their credit history.

## 🧠 Project Summary
We built a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. The project walks through the full data science workflow:
- Data loading and inspection
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Probability prediction of default on full data

## 📁 Files Included
- `credit-risk-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with all project steps
- `default_probabilities.csv`: Output file with predicted default probabilities *(optional)*
- `README.md`: Project description and instructions

## 📊 Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier** (from scikit-learn)

## 🚀 How to Run
To run this notebook locally:
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python and the following packages installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn
3. Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and merging
- Feature engineering (e.g. one-hot encoding)
- Imbalanced class handling
- Model evaluation with metrics like confusion matrix and ROC AUC
- Exporting predictions
